# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game repository! This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The Simon Game is a memory-based pattern matching game that challenges players to repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. Test your memory and see how far you can go!
